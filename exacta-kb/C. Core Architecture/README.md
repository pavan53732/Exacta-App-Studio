# C. Core Architecture

## Purpose
This section describes the internal architecture of Exacta App Studio: component boundaries, data flow, and determinism guarantees.

## Documents
- [System Architecture](System%20Architecture.md)
- [Orchestration State Machine](Orchestration%20State%20Machine.md)
- [Memory Model and Large Codebase Handling](Memory%20Model%20and%20Large%20Codebase%20Handling.md)
- [File System Safety and Diff Engine](File%20System%20Safety%20and%20Diff%20Engine.md)

## Scope Rules
- Architecture MUST be described as explicit components with explicit contracts.
- Execution side effects MUST remain gated and auditable.
