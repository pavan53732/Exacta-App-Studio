# A. Product & Principles

## Purpose
This section defines what Exacta App Studio is, what it promises to users, and what it explicitly will not do.
These documents define the user-facing contract and the non-negotiable principles that govern all behavior.

## Documents
- [User Contract & Mental Model](User Contract & Mental Model.md)
- [Non-Goals & Explicit Exclusions](Non-Goals & Explicit Exclusions.md)
- [Core Principles and Invariants](Core Principles and Invariants.md)
- [UI Capability Gating & Why Blocked Contract](UI Capability Gating & Why Blocked Contract.md)

## Scope Rules
- This section SHOULD describe behavior in plain language, but it MAY reference invariants and enforcement mechanisms.
- Any promise made here MUST be supported by detailed specs elsewhere in the KB.
