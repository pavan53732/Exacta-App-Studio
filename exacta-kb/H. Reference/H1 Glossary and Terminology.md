## Core Concepts

### Intent

A structured representation of what the user wants to accomplish.

- Extracted from natural language user input
- Belongs to a closed taxonomy of types
- Contains confidence score, target specification, and constraints
- Does not describe *how* to accomplish the goal (that's the Plan)

**Example:** User says "Add a login button." Intent is `\\\\\\\{ type: AddFeature, target: "login button", confidence: 0.92 \\\\\\\}`

---

### Plan

An ordered sequence of steps that, when executed, fulfills an Intent.

- Generated by AI, validated by system
- Automatically executed after validation
- Contains steps, dependencies, and inherited constraints
- Versioned; failed plans increment version number

**Example:** A Plan to add a login button might have steps: (1) Create button XAML, (2) Add click handler, (3) Wire to auth service.

---

### Step

A single atomic unit of work within a Plan.

- Targets specific files and symbols
- Has a defined operation type (Create, Modify, Delete)
- May depend on other steps
- Produces exactly one diff (or none for non-file operations)

**Example:** "Modify MainWindow.xaml to add button element"

---

### Context

The information provided to AI for a specific operation.

- Assembled by the system, not the AI
- Includes relevant file content, symbols, and constraints
- Bounded by token limits
- Does not include chat history or previous sessions

**Example:** For editing `UserService.cs`, context includes that file plus `IUserService.cs` interface.

---

### Index (Project Index)

A structured, queryable representation of the project codebase.

- Contains file tree, symbol tables, and dependency graph
- Built from source files using deterministic rules
- Updated when files change
- The system's "memory" of the project (AI has no memory)

**Example:** Index knows that `UserService` is a class in `Services/UserService.cs` that implements `IUserService`.

---

### Diff

A unified diff format specification of changes to a file.

- Generated by AI based on context
- Validated by system before application
- Contains only the lines that change, plus context lines
- Must apply cleanly or is rejected

**Example:**

```
--- a/MainWindow.xaml
+++ b/MainWindow.xaml
@@ -10,6 +10,7 @@
     <StackPanel>
+        <Button Content="Login" Click="LoginButton_Click"/>
     </StackPanel>
```

---

### Validation

The process of verifying that an artifact meets defined requirements.

Types of validation:

- **Intent validation:** Confidence threshold, taxonomy match
- **Plan validation:** Completeness, dependency ordering, granularity
- **Diff validation:** Format correctness, path safety, context match
- **Syntax validation:** Parse success after diff application
- **Build validation:** Compilation success

---

### Orchestrator

The central component that controls execution flow.

- Maintains the state machine
- Coordinates between all other components
- Executes plans autonomously with smart retry logic
- **Evaluates policies via Gate Pipeline** *(Changed in V2)*
- Handles errors, recovery, and notifications
- Persists state for crash recovery

The Orchestrator is the only component that can initiate state transitions.

---

### Autonomy Profile *(New in V2)*

A named policy bundle that controls how autonomous the agent operates.

- **PROFILE-SAFE:** Near-manual operation, most actions require confirmation
- **PROFILE-DEV:** Semi-autonomous, low/medium risk auto-executes
- **PROFILE-FULL-AUTO:** Fully autonomous, all policy-compliant actions execute

Profiles control: shell execution, file modifications, network access, self-upgrade, approval thresholds.

---

### Gate Pipeline *(New in V2)*

The evaluation system that determines whether an action proceeds.

- Evaluates gates in priority order: Security → Policy → Risk → Quality → User Confirm
- Returns: ALLOW (execute), DENY (block), or CONFIRM (ask user)
- All actions flow through the pipeline; no bypass exists

---

### Policy Engine *(New in V2)*

The component that evaluates actions against active profile rules.

- Loads active profile configuration
- Evaluates policy rules against action
- Returns decision (ALLOW/DENY/CONFIRM) with matched rule
- Logs all decisions for audit

---

### Shell Executor *(New in V2)*

The component responsible for executing shell commands safely.

- Filters commands through allowlist/blocklist
- Enforces sandbox (project root jail)
- Applies resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
- Logs all executions
- Provides rollback strategies for state-modifying commands

---

## Component Terms

### Chat UI

The user interface for entering requests and viewing results.

- Displays plans, diffs, and progress
- Shows notifications for important decisions
- Provides interrupt capability for user oversight
- Queues new intents during execution
- Does not control execution (Orchestrator does)

---

### AI Interface

The abstraction layer for communicating with AI providers.

- Formats prompts
- Parses responses
- Handles rate limiting and retries
- Injects API keys securely
- Never stores conversation history

---

### File Gateway

The component responsible for all file system access.

- Enforces project root jail
- Performs atomic writes
- Maintains rollback stack
- Validates paths before access
- Logs all operations

---

### Build Executor

The component that invokes local build tools.

- Detects appropriate build tool
- Runs build commands
- Captures output
- Classifies errors
- Does not modify source files

---

## State Terms

### Idle

Orchestrator state: No active plan. Waiting for user input.

---

### Planning

Orchestrator state: Generating execution plan from validated intent.

---

### BackgroundWorking

Orchestrator state: Plan is executing autonomously in the background. UI shows progress and allows interruption.

---

### Executing

Orchestrator state: Approved plan is being executed step by step.

---

### Paused

Orchestrator state: Execution suspended by user or system. Resumable after validation.

---

### Failed

Orchestrator state: Execution encountered an unrecoverable error. Requires user intervention to proceed.

---

### Completed

Orchestrator state: All steps in the plan executed successfully.

---

### Cancelling

Orchestrator state: User requested cancellation. Rolling back applied changes before returning to Idle.

---

### GateEvaluation *(New in V2)*

Orchestrator state: Action is being evaluated by the Gate Pipeline. Determines whether to ALLOW, DENY, or CONFIRM.

---

### WaitingForConfirmation *(New in V2)*

Orchestrator state: Gate Pipeline returned CONFIRM. Waiting for explicit user approval before proceeding.

---

### AutoRollingBack *(New in V2)*

Orchestrator state: Autonomous action failed and system is automatically rolling back changes.

---

## Operation Terms

### Atomic Write

A file write operation that either fully succeeds or has no effect.

Implementation: Write to temp file, verify, rename to target.

---

### Rollback

The process of restoring files to their state before a plan executed.

- Uses preserved original content
- Applied in reverse order
- Validates file hashes before restoring

---

### Notification

An alert sent to the user about important system decisions or state changes.

Types:

- Low-risk operations: Silent execution with log entry
- Medium-risk operations: Notification after execution
- High-risk operations: Notification before execution with interrupt option

---

### Smart Retry

An automatic recovery strategy that attempts to fix failures without user intervention.

Behavior:

- Analyzes error type and selects appropriate strategy
- Attempts up to 3 retries with different approaches
- Escalates to user if all retries fail
- Provides detailed context for manual intervention

---

### Graceful Degradation

A design principle: When uncertain, attempt recovery with best-effort strategies before escalating to user.

**Scope:** Applies only to non-security and non-policy failures. Security and policy violations always fail-closed per INV-OPS-1.

**V2 Enhancement:** Autonomous failures now trigger auto-rollback before user escalation.

---

### Self-Upgrade *(New in V2)*

The capability for the agent to modify and upgrade itself.

- Only available in PROFILE-FULL-AUTO with explicit config
- Agent can upgrade but never self-authorize (flows through Gate Pipeline)
- No hot-patching of running binary
- Rollback always available
- Cannot modify security, policy, or audit code

---

### Approval Source *(New in V2)*

The entity that approved an action. One of:

- **User:** Explicit human confirmation
- **Policy:** Policy Engine automatic approval based on rules
- **Profile:** Active Autonomy Profile pre-configured trust
- **Guardian:** Root authority that delegates policy and profile approvals. All "Policy" and "Profile" approvals are cryptographically backed by Guardian authorization.

All actions are logged with their approval source.

**Note:** Policy and Profile approvals are Guardian-delegated authorities. Guardian is the single root of trust for all system-level authorizations.

---

## Index Terms

### Symbol Table

A data structure mapping symbol names to their definitions.

Contains: Types, methods, properties, fields, and their locations.

---

### Dependency Graph

A directed graph representing relationships between code elements.

Edges represent: Inheritance, implementation, calls, references.

---

### File Hash

A SHA-256 hash of file content used to detect changes.

Used for: Drift detection, rollback verification, cache invalidation.

---

### Context Resolution

The process of selecting which files and symbols to include in AI context for a specific operation.

Goal: Include relevant information while staying within token limits.

---

## Constraint Terms

### Constraint

A user-specified requirement that must be satisfied by the generated code.

Types:

- `MUST`: Required to be true
- `MUST_NOT`: Required to be false
- `PREFER`: Desired but not required

---

### Project Root

The top-level directory containing the project. All file operations are restricted to this directory and its descendants.

---

### Project Root Jail

The security boundary preventing file access outside the project root.

---

## Provider Terms

### AI Provider

An external service that processes prompts and returns completions.

Examples: OpenAI, OpenRouter, local LLM servers.

---

### API Key

A secret credential used to authenticate with an AI provider.

Storage: Windows Credential Manager (encrypted).

---

### Token

A unit of text as processed by an AI model. Roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words in English.

Used for: Context limits, cost estimation.

---

### Token Limit

The maximum number of tokens that can be sent to or received from an AI provider in a single request.
