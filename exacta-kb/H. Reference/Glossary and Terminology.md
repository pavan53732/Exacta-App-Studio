# Glossary and Terminology

This document defines all core terms used in Exacta App Studio documentation. When a term is used elsewhere, it has exactly the meaning defined here.

---

## Core Concepts

### Intent
A structured representation of what the user wants to accomplish.
- Extracted from natural language user input
- Belongs to a closed taxonomy of types
- Contains confidence score, target specification, and constraints
- Does not describe *how* to accomplish the goal (that's the Plan)

**Example:** User says "Add a login button." Intent is `{ type: AddFeature, target: "login button", confidence: 0.92 }`

---

### Plan
An ordered sequence of steps that, when executed, fulfills an Intent.
- Generated by AI, validated by system
- Immutable once approved
- Contains steps, dependencies, and inherited constraints
- Versioned; rejected plans increment version number

**Example:** A Plan to add a login button might have steps: (1) Create button XAML, (2) Add click handler, (3) Wire to auth service.

---

### Step
A single atomic unit of work within a Plan.
- Targets specific files and symbols
- Has a defined operation type (Create, Modify, Delete)
- May depend on other steps
- Produces exactly one diff (or none for non-file operations)

**Example:** "Modify MainWindow.xaml to add button element"

---

### Context
The information provided to AI for a specific operation.
- Assembled by the system, not the AI
- Includes relevant file content, symbols, and constraints
- Bounded by token limits
- Does not include chat history or previous sessions

**Example:** For editing `UserService.cs`, context includes that file plus `IUserService.cs` interface.

---

### Index (Project Index)
A structured, queryable representation of the project codebase.
- Contains file tree, symbol tables, and dependency graph
- Built from source files using deterministic rules
- Updated when files change
- The system's "memory" of the project (AI has no memory)

**Example:** Index knows that `UserService` is a class in `Services/UserService.cs` that implements `IUserService`.

---

### Diff
A unified diff format specification of changes to a file.
- Generated by AI based on context
- Validated by system before application
- Contains only the lines that change, plus context lines
- Must apply cleanly or is rejected

**Example:**
```

--- a/MainWindow.xaml

+++ b/MainWindow.xaml

@@ -10,6 +10,7 @@

<StackPanel>

- <Button Content="Login" Click="LoginButton_Click"/>
    
    </StackPanel>
    

```

---

### Validation
The process of verifying that an artifact meets defined requirements.

Types of validation:
- **Intent validation:** Confidence threshold, taxonomy match
- **Plan validation:** Completeness, dependency ordering, granularity
- **Diff validation:** Format correctness, path safety, context match
- **Syntax validation:** Parse success after diff application
- **Build validation:** Compilation success

---

### Orchestrator
The central component that controls execution flow.
- Maintains the state machine
- Coordinates between all other components
- Enforces approval gates
- Handles errors and recovery
- Persists state for crash recovery

The Orchestrator is the only component that can initiate state transitions.

---

## Component Terms

### Chat UI
The user interface for entering requests and viewing results.
- Displays plans, diffs, and progress
- Captures user approvals and rejections
- Queues new intents during execution
- Does not control execution (Orchestrator does)

---

### AI Interface
The abstraction layer for communicating with AI providers.
- Formats prompts
- Parses responses
- Handles rate limiting and retries
- Injects API keys securely
- Never stores conversation history

---

### File Gateway
The component responsible for all file system access.
- Enforces project root jail
- Performs atomic writes
- Maintains rollback stack
- Validates paths before access
- Logs all operations

---

### Build Executor
The component that invokes local build tools.
- Detects appropriate build tool
- Runs build commands
- Captures output
- Classifies errors
- Does not modify source files

---

## State Terms

### Idle
Orchestrator state: No active plan. Waiting for user input.

---

### Planning
Orchestrator state: Generating execution plan from validated intent.

---

### AwaitingApproval
Orchestrator state: Plan generated and presented to user. Execution blocked until user approves or rejects.

---

### Executing
Orchestrator state: Approved plan is being executed step by step.

---

### Paused
Orchestrator state: Execution suspended by user or system. Resumable after validation.

---

### Failed
Orchestrator state: Execution encountered an unrecoverable error. Requires user intervention to proceed.

---

### Completed
Orchestrator state: All steps in the plan executed successfully.

---

### Cancelling
Orchestrator state: User requested cancellation. Rolling back applied changes before returning to Idle.

---

## Operation Terms

### Atomic Write
A file write operation that either fully succeeds or has no effect.  
Implementation: Write to temp file, verify, rename to target.

---

### Rollback
The process of restoring files to their state before a plan executed.
- Uses preserved original content
- Applied in reverse order
- Validates file hashes before restoring

---

### Approval Gate
A point in the workflow where execution pauses until the user explicitly approves.

Examples:
- Plan approval before execution
- Destructive operation confirmation
- Preview execution warning

---

### Fail-Closed
A design principle: When uncertain, refuse to proceed rather than guess.  
Opposite of "best effort" or "fail-open."

---

## Index Terms

### Symbol Table
A data structure mapping symbol names to their definitions.  
Contains: Types, methods, properties, fields, and their locations.

---

### Dependency Graph
A directed graph representing relationships between code elements.  
Edges represent: Inheritance, implementation, calls, references.

---

### File Hash
A SHA-256 hash of file content used to detect changes.  
Used for: Drift detection, rollback verification, cache invalidation.

---

### Context Resolution
The process of selecting which files and symbols to include in AI context for a specific operation.  
Goal: Include relevant information while staying within token limits.

---

## Constraint Terms

### Constraint
A user-specified requirement that must be satisfied by the generated code.

Types:
- `MUST`: Required to be true
- `MUST_NOT`: Required to be false
- `PREFER`: Desired but not required

---

### Project Root
The top-level directory containing the project. All file operations are restricted to this directory and its descendants.

---

### Project Root Jail
The security boundary preventing file access outside the project root.

---

## Provider Terms

### AI Provider
An external service that processes prompts and returns completions.  
Examples: OpenAI, OpenRouter, local LLM servers.

---

### API Key
A secret credential used to authenticate with an AI provider.  
Storage: Windows Credential Manager (encrypted).

---

### Token
A unit of text as processed by an AI model. Roughly 4 characters or 0.75 words in English.  
Used for: Context limits, cost estimation.

---

### Token Limit
The maximum number of tokens that can be sent to or received from an AI provider in a single request.

---

## Usage Notes

### Capitalization
- Component names are capitalized: Orchestrator, File Gateway, AI Interface
- State names are capitalized: Idle, Executing, Failed
- Generic terms are lowercase: intent, plan, diff, context

### Precision
When a term has a specific meaning in this glossary, use that meaning exactly. Avoid synonyms that might introduce ambiguity.

| Instead of | Use |
| --- | --- |
| "request" (for user input) | Intent |
| "task" (for unit of work) | Step |
| "change" (for file modification) | Diff |
| "state machine" (for central controller) | Orchestrator |
