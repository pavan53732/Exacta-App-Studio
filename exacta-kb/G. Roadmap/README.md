# G. Roadmap

## Purpose
This section contains the development roadmap and phase definitions.
It specifies scope boundaries and planned expansions, without weakening current guarantees.

## Documents
- [Phase Plan and Scope Control](Phase%20Plan%20and%20Scope%20Control.md)
- [Advanced Mode & Guardrail Overrides (Future)](Advanced%20Mode%20%26%20Guardrail%20Overrides%20%28Future%29.md)

## Scope Rules
- Roadmap items MUST NOT be treated as current capabilities.
- Future features MUST not violate the global invariants.
