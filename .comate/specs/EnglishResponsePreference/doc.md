# English Response Preference Doc
## Requirement Scenario
The user explicitly requested all replies and generated documentation to be in English. This applies to all subsequent interactions and output files.

## Handling Logic
1. All agent responses to the user must use English language exclusively.
2. Generated documentation (tasks.md, summary.md) must follow English formatting and terminology.
3. No code modifications are needed as this is a communication preference.

## Impact Scope
- No changes to source code files (src/, tests/, etc.).
- Affects agent-user interaction flow and documentation generation stages.

## Expected Outcome
All agent outputs (replies, docs) are in English, aligning with the user's explicit request.
